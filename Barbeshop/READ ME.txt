HELLO! My apologies for the sudden switch in soundscape scene, but my friends were being less than helpful recording 
audio, making completing the first project nearly impossible. So I made lemonade, and produced a much higher quality 
solo version of this project, and changed nearly everything. So now its a barbershop, with an apparently mute customer.

cheers
