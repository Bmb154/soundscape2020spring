| date | what's due | expected files |
|----|----|----|
| Tues Jan 21 | Soundscape Proposal | Thinking in writing about what you'd like to do for this assignment, posted to the appropriate [Issue Queue](https://github.com/benmiller314/cdm2020spring/issues). This post should include:<ul><li>some basic premise of your narrative;</li><li>some sense of setting; and</li><li>a link to your repository, which is the fork of this assignment.</li></ul> In addition, please add a new file to your repo called ASSETS.md, containing a **prospective assets chart** as per <a href="https://pitt.box.com/s/xovvpta4x2tq1cs9ywr61d2g1udka8m5" title="file on limited circulation, in keeping with educational fair use">*Writer/Designer* p. 149</a>. <div class="alert alert-warning">Not sure where to start? Try one of the <a href="#parachute-prompts">"parachute prompts"</a> below.</div>|
| Thurs Jan 23 | Soundscape Preview | An early snapshot of your progress, to get the gears turning. Turn in: <ul><li> A layered **Audacity project file (.aup)**, showing the arrangement of your sounds so far (need not be a complete soundscape or narrative yet).</li><li> A static **[screenshot](https://www.take-a-screenshot.org/) (.png or .jpg)** of your Audacity file in progress (for comparison later to subsequent drafts).</li><li>The **_data folder** associated with your Audacity file, which should contain at least two recorded sounds.</li><li> A plain text (.txt) or markdown (.md) file, explaining in at least 300 words **what you're showing us** in this preview. Feel free also to ask questions or lay out next steps for yourself!</li><li> An updated **ASSETS.md**, now with the files you actually recorded or otherwise obtained. <ul><li>Add source documentation for any outside sources – and your permission to use them (e.g. licenses, fair use; see *Writer/Designer* p. 160-165).</li></ul></li></ul> |
| Tues Jan 28 | Soundscape Draft | A solid attempt at a complete soundscape narrative, ideally at the target length. Turn in:<ul><li>A layered **Audacity project file (.aup)**, showing the arrangement of your sounds so far</li><li>The **_data folder** associated with your Audacity file, containing your audio snippets.</li><li>At least one more static **[screenshot](https://www.take-a-screenshot.org/) (.png or .jpg)** of your Audacity file in progress. <ul><li>When to screenshot? Moments that seem worth remembering as you go: where did you level up, or realize something, or get stuck?</li></ul></li><li>An **updated README.md file**, introducing the soundscape narrative to a new audience.</li><li>An **updated ASSETS.md file**, including documentation of any outside sources – and your permission to use them (e.g. licenses, fair use); see *Writer/Designer* p. 160-165.</li></ul>  |
| Sun Feb 2 | Soundscape Final Draft | Include the same five components as in the earlier draft, but updated. |
| Tues Feb 4 | Soundscape Reflection | Give a sense of the work you put into your soundscape and whether it accomplishes what you wanted it to. Turn in: <ul><li>at least 500 words describing the work you did</li><li>at least two screenshots showing your work in progress</li><li>at least one photograph of a notecard with feedback that you responded to in revising (and please say how)</li><li>your own assessment of how you met the baseline criteria for the class, as well as aspirational criteria as appropriate </li></ul> **Post your reflections to the course site's [Issue queue](https://github.com/benmiller314/cdm2020spring/issues)**, to make it easier to embed images. (If you want to then copy the source code into a file in your own repo called reflections.md, I won't stop you!) |


## Setup

1. Fork this repository to create a new version you can control.
2. This will give you an online copy, but for editing purposes you'll definitely want a local copy on your computer. [Follow the cloning instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) for your operating system, making sure to put the cloned folder in a place on your computer where you can easily find it.
3. _Optional:_ Because some sound files can take up a lot of space, you may want to use [Git Large File Storage](https://git-lfs.github.com/), an add-on service that lets you designate certain file extensions as worth tracking and storing off-site, rather than directly in your repository.
   * If you want to do this, it's pretty easy! You'll just need to install the LFS service at the command line to make it work.
   * Simply go to https://git-lfs.github.com, download, and follow the two steps on the screen!
   * Once it's set up at the command line, git-lfs will also work through GitHub Desktop.

## Parachute Prompts

As it says above, the genre, subject, and setting for this project are up to you. But if you're stuck for where to start, try one of these options:

* **Day in the Life of...** Over the course of a few days, record 40 or more 5-second snippets of sound that tell us where you are and what you're doing. (The challenge will be to make at least some of these sounds different from everyone else's: parts of a particular soundscape, not a generic one.) Overlay a soundtrack that shows your energy – or the energy you'd like to have; fiction is fair game, after all – at various times of day. Human voices, including yours, are welcome!
* **Interview for a Podcast** You know that one friend or family member who's always telling great stories? Ask them for a new one, or to re-tell one of your favorites, and this time, get it on "tape." Record more than you'll need, then go to the editing room to recreate the story in sound: boil it down to highlights, introduce your speaker and yourself, then add a background track and incidentals to round out the sonic atmosphere.
