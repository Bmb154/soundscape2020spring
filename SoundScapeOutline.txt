Current Soundscape Idea/ Really Rough outline
LAN party with group banter/music
Pizza Arrives-one group member leaves to grab the pizza
Group Gets pizza/soda/snacks out and resumes banter

Goals
-The atmosphere should be friendly/cozy, which may be difficult when recording genuine audio of my friends
-The audio should not feel cheesy/Put together and should be indistinguishable from an actual recording for a casual listener
-Bloopers?
-Actually use my expensive microphone for its purpose
