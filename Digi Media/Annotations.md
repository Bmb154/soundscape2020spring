+ *Crites quips "eh, I think the pizzas here."

+ *Thomas replies "No shit"

+ Sounds of a pizza guy can be heard down stairs (What kind of noises do a pizza transaction involve? > Maybe some distant door opening? Change being dropped? Somone saying "Did you order a pizza?" ouch

+ Maybe one or two lines about "I hope he got wings" or "Pass the Chips- Ah, nvm we got pizza comin. Screw it, pass the chips"


```
(End of to be added)

Door opens 

An announcment is made about the presence of pizza, which is met by a cacophony of excited nerds
